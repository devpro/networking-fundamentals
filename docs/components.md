## Trunk

> A network trunk is a communications line or link designed to carry multiple signals simultaneously to provide network access between two points. Trunks typically connect switching centers in a communications system. The signals can convey any type of communications data.

> A networking trunk can consist of several wires, cables or fiber optic strands bundled together in a single physical cable to maximize the available bandwidth. Or it can consist of a single high-capacity link over which many signals are multiplexed.
